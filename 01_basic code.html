        <p>VALLABHBHAI JHAVERBHAI PATEL, ONE OF THE SIX CHILDREN OF JHAVERBHAI PATEL AND LADBA, WAS BORN IN NADIAD, GUJARAT. THERE IS NO RECORD OF HIS DATE OF BIRTH. THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED DATE, OCTOBER 31, 1875, OF WHICH THE SOURCE IS HIS MATRICULATION CERTIFICATE, WAS CHOSEN BY VALLABHBHAI HIMSELF WHILE FILLING IN A FORM.</p>

The family was an agriculturist one of the Lewa Patidar Community,
 and could in terms of economic status be described as lower middle-class.
  It was poor and had no tradition of education.

Vallabhbhaiâ€™s childhood was spent away from books, in the ancestral fields at Karamsad.
 He was already in his late teens when he passed out from the Middle School at Karamsad and went to the High School at Nadiad,
 from where he matriculated in 1897.

Even as a young boy Vallabhbhai displayed qualities of organization and leadership that
 marked him out for his future role. Once as a sixth-form boy 
 he organized a successful strike of his classmates that lasted for three days 
 to teach a lesson to one of the teachers who was unduly fond of the rod.
